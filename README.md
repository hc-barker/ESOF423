Senior Center App

Overall goal of the Senior Center App is to provide an interface for senior centers to capture information about their members. Such as:

~Basic information

~Membership status

~Attendance

~Special diets/medical issues/disabilities

~Home delivered meals vs. center meals

~Activities

~Services

~Emergency contacts

Administrators will be able to manage volunteers, create reports to be accuarate for grant writing, add new members and activities/services, run reports, manage forms and have full access to and ability to edit all areas.

Volunteers can ckech people in for meals and activities, print forms, update basic information. -This postion would have limited access to edit and view specific information about members.

Members can register themselves with the center and add activities/meals.
